    <h2>More Git and GitHub Secrets</h2>

    <p>This talk covers both Git and GitHub: different tricks I've picked up after three years at GitHub, helpful
      advice on common gripes I've seen in support tickets and tweets, and just general nifty things that make you a
      faster, more capable technologist.</p>

    <div class="speaker-info">
      <a href="//zachholman.com/">Zach Holman</a> joined GitHub in 2010 as one of their first engineering hires.
      Initially working on what would become GitHub Enterprise, he now hacks on new features and frequently gives
      talks about building products and growing startups. He lives in San Francisco.

    <h2>Shrink To Grow</h2>

    <p>Ruby has grown in the last 20 years. The feature-set and field of usage has increased. But also its code-size
      has reached an exceptional size. For many systems Ruby is nowadays to large.<br/><br/>

      To reach new systems we have to re-think the way we implement Ruby. We have to shrink Ruby to be able to grow
      into a new field with an army of small devices.<br/><br/>

      This talk will cover the development of mruby. The current state of the implementation and the reason why you
      should contribute to it.

    <div class="speaker-info">
      <a href="http://bovensiepen.net/">Daniel Bovensiepen</a> is building Metros all around the world and empowers
      Ruby in areas nobody would expect it. At night he is contributing to mruby to push it to even more areas of his
      daily job. The last 6 years he spend most of his time in China and actually helped building Line 8 and Line 10
      in Beijing.

    <h2>Writing Ruby web server for node.js</h2>

    <p>Yes, I'm that crazy, I want to write Ruby server which runs on node.js! In this talk I will build a server
      written using webruby, compile everything to a single JS file, and runs it on node.js. Let's see how fast it
      will be comparing to MRI, jruby and pure JS running in node.js. This may not be that useful in real world, but
      let's just have some fun here :)</p>

    <h2>從 Classes 到 Objects：那些 OOP 教我的事</h2>

    <p>一直以來，關於面向對象程序設計(OOP)，我們都習慣於使用類(class)進行設計，利用各種設計模式捕捉整個系統的靜態藍圖，卻忘記了 OO 的本質其實是物件之間的訊息互動。不同於其他靜態的 OOP 語言，Ruby
      極佳地支援以對象(object)為主角的設計思維。本議程將比較 class-oriented design 和 object-oriented design 的差異，以及在 Ruby 中如何應用以對象為主的設計技巧。</p>

    <h2>How To Build A Sync-Like Async Web Server</h2>

    <p>What is an HTTP server? How many protocol specifications are involved in Rack? Why event rocks or sucks? Do you
      know the design of digital circuits decides your code style? How scheduling scheme affects server performance?
      Does Ruby forbids or offers concurrency? Will the todays approaches for performance become in vain when hardware
      evolves? You may not get the answers in this talk because... it's about building a web server.</p>

    <h2>Test your Rails application with pleasure</h2>

    <p>Lots of developers trust Test Driven Development (TDD) is a sweet way of building web applications, while a
      large proportion don't do so as I heard as test turns them down at some point. However, writing the test doesn't
      have to pull down your productivity or bring frustration in fact. This topic shares my experience of testing
      Rails applications with happy face :) including my thoughts of TDD, how to speed up running the test etc. Hope
      it helps people return to the sweet way and enjoy in writing test.</p>

    <h2>How entrepreneurs can use Ruby and Rails to accelerate their companies with Lean Startup strategies.</h2>

    <p>Today's top tech entrepreneurs use Lean Startup and Customer Development techniques to rapidly test the market
      for opportunity before investing intensive development into a product. With its many Gems, community support and
      infrastructure Ruby on Rails is and ideal language for developing a product to test demand using these
      techniques. Kevin Dewalt will share specific tactics he has used with Ruby and Rails in developing his own
      products. If you are an aspiring or current entrepreneur, you'll benefit from knowing not only just how to apply
      these techniques - but why. </p>

    <p>Have you heard of a web framework called Ruby on Rails? There're a lot of stuff hidden under the hood of Ruby
      on Rails that you might not know about, and it might be really useful for you even if you aren't creating a web

    <h2>RSpec: the good parts and the tricky parts</h2>

    <p>RSpec is a popular tool for TDD with ruby. In this talk, we start with the seemingly easy topic on using
      subject and let. Then we dive into the debate on testing using should_receive vs. asserting side effects. We
      walk through the pros and cons of both approaches and conclude this section with different scenarios when each
      approach excels. Last part of this talk covers some traps and caveats of RSpec.</p>

    <h2>Discovering Better Object Oriented Design with Tests</h2>

    <p>Some times our projects becomes bigger and bigger, a lot of objects will be coupling together, it seems bad.
      But if you use stubs and mocks in your test, it will drive you to develop a better object oriented design. The
      test will drive us to abstract some new objects that beyond Rails.</p>

    <p>做为程序员，我们在工作时经常担任工匠（Artisan）的角色，去实现别人设计好的产品，但有时候，我们也渴望像一个艺术家（Artist）那样去创作......其实，设计并没有那么难，如果能够为你的Library设计出好的API，为你的CLI工具设计出人性化的使用方法，你就有能力设计出简洁，清晰，流畅的图形化用户体验。这个演讲将打破程序员与设计师之间的鸿沟，描绘出Unix哲学与良好的UI设计间的共同之处，让程序员也可以去尝试设计，从Artisan走向Artist。</p>

    <h2>红宝石，编码乐 (Code Ruby, Be Happy)</h2>

    <p class="topic-summary">Programming is difficult. As programmers, we know how hard it is to write good code. Some
      of the job of a good programming language is to make this easier. In part, languages do that by having a
      convenient syntax and good libraries. But there's something else, too. They should make you happy when you use
      them, because then you'll do your best work. <br/><br/>

      The Ruby language makes me happy. Interestingly, many of the reasons I'm happy using Ruby are the same reasons
      my wife and I love being in China. <br/><br/>

      In this talk I'll explore the reasons why both China and Ruby make me happy.</p>
